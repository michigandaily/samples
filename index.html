          This guide is also self-referential in that I will be describing
          concepts that are reflected in how this page is laid out. It will be
          useful to have the code for this page open as you read.

        <h2>Layout</h2>
        <p>
          Most websites include a CSS reset, a set of stylings that remove style
          inconsistencies between browsers. This page has a rather minimal reset
          to remove margin and padding from the body, and to remove margin from
          headings and paragraphs. While the default margins for text elements
          are useful to provide spacing, it is preferable to manually control
          the spacing through grid layout gaps.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a news organization, many of our special websites will require
          large amounts of prose. People tend to have a hard time reading when a
          text container is wide. This is particularly an issue for some people
          with disabilities.
        </p>
        <blockquote
          style="font-family: var(--font-serif); display: grid; gap: 0.5rem"
        >
          For people with some reading or vision disabilities, long lines of
          text can become a significant barrier. They have trouble keeping their
          place and following the flow of text. Having a narrow block of text
          makes it easier for them to continue on to the next line in a block.
          Lines should not exceed 80 characters or glyphs (40 if [Chinese,
          Japanese and Korean]), where glyphs are the element of writing in the
          writing system for the text.
          <footer style="font-family: var(--font-sans-serif)">

        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Therefore, I start most prose-heavy layouts with a section that is 60
          to 80 characters wide. CSS includes a
          <code><b>ch</b></code> unit to work with the width of a single
          character glyph. Note that setting a maximum width is naturally
          responsive, even on mobile devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          In most cases, text should be centered on the screen. Centering can be
          accomplished with horizontal margin set to <code><b>auto</b></code
          >. It is also important for a section of text to take up all allotted
          space within the maximum width constraint by setting the width to
          <code><b>100%</b></code
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some padding should also be added around the text container to ensure
          that the text does not touch the screen edges. This is especially
          important for mobile devices. Note that padding will add to the width
          of the container by default, making mobile screens horizontally
          scrollable. To prevent this, set
          <code><b>box-sizing: border-box</b></code> on the text container.
        </p>
        <p>
          With all that we've described in terms of grid layout, maximum
          character width, text centering and mobile responsiveness, we arrive
          at the following set of styles for prose layout.
        </p>
        <pre><code><b>section {
  display: grid;
  gap: 0.5rem;

  max-width: 80ch;
  width: 100%;

  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 0.25rem 0.75rem;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}</b></code></pre>
        <p>
          Although I describe this as "prose layout," all of the ideas are
          pertinent to any good responsive layout, regardless of the amount of
          text content.

        <h3>Scroll layout</h3>
        <p>
          There is a common storytelling method in journalism called
          "scrollytelling." In essence, a visual element remains in the
          background or to the side of an area of text as the user scrolls. The
          visual element usually changes several times as the reader reaches
          specific areas of text, denoting some sort of relation between the
          change and the text. Scrolling layouts are often used in data
          visualizations or animations to show transition points in a story.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="scroll-container">
        <figure class="scroll-figure scroll-stack">
          <div
            style="background-color: #ab14b7; width: 100%; height: 300px"
          ></div>
        </figure>
        <div class="scroll-step-container scroll-stack">
          <div class="scroll-step">
            <div class="scroll-step-content">
              <p>
                There are a few important areas for a scrolling layout. First,
                there is a container with <code><b>position: relative</b></code
                >. This container will have two immediate children: 1) a figure
                that will remain in the background and 2) a container of steps.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="scroll-step">
            <div class="scroll-step-content">
              <p>
                The figure should stick to the top of the screen, relative to
                the scrolling container. In this case, it is also taking up the
                entire height of the screen.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="scroll-step">
            <div class="scroll-step-content">
              <p>
                The figure should also be placed behind the steps (in
                three-dimensional space) such that the written content appears
                in front of the figure. The figure should usually horizontally
                and vertically center any of the content inside it.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="scroll-step">
            <div class="scroll-step-content">
              <pre><code><b>.scroll-figure {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  margin: 0;

  min-height: 100vh;
  min-height: 100svh;

  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  z-index: 0;
}</b></code></pre>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="scroll-step">
            <div class="scroll-step-content">
              <p>
                The figure should also have something inside it. In our case, we
                created a purple rectangle that is 500 pixels tall.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="scroll-step">
            <div class="scroll-step-content">
              <p>
                Secondly, the child container should be made to render in front
                of the figure. In our case, the width is also less than the
                figure's width.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="scroll-step">
            <div class="scroll-step-content">
              <pre><code><b>.scroll-step-container {

              <p>
                A step itself should take up the entire screen height. Within
                the step, there is another content container that has a white
                background. This provides the visual illusion that steps are
                smaller than they are. Note that the content container does not
                take up the entire height of the screen.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="scroll-step">

              <pre><code><b>.scroll-step {
  min-height: 100vh;

.scroll-step-content {
  border: 2px solid black;
  background: 
    rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
  color: white;
  padding: 1rem;

  display: grid;
  gap: 1rem;

          <div class="scroll-step">
            <div class="scroll-step-content">
              <p>
                While all of the steps on the page take up the full height of
                the screen, it may be useful depending on the story for specific
                steps to take up more or less of the screen to shorten or
                lengthen the amount of time it takes to scroll between steps.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="scroll-step">
            <div class="scroll-step-content">
              <p>
                For the most part, the (text) content within each step should be
                short. This is especially important on mobile devices so as to
                not completely cover the background figure.
              </p>

                There is a browser compatibility issue regarding the
                three-dimensional nature of our layout. The figure is meant to
                always be behind the steps, but this is not the case in Safari
                without some extra configuration for the figure and the
                container of steps.

                This page does not use <code><b>scrollama</b></code> to change

          <p>
            Although this default width is useful for prose, there are also
            situations when you might want more width to work with. In those
            cases, you will want to create "breakout" sections.

          <p>
            In a breakout section, remove the maximum width associated with a
            section. Then, you will have the full width of the screen to work
            with.

        <div class="inline">
          <p>
            If there are parts of the breakout section that you want to retain
            the prose width, you'll want to re-apply the styles that set the
            maximum character width. Furthermore, the maximum width can be
            customized to be more than the prose width but less than the full
            width, as demonstrated in the blue rectangle above.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that breakout sections are less visually imposing on mobile
            devices due to the small screen width.

          <h3>Grid layout</h3>
          <p>
            Grids are a powerful layout approach. They can be used for simple
            vertical layouts like this overall page, but can also be used for
            more complex two-dimensional layouts. Grids can be made to be
            responsive by default in some cases, eliminating the need for media
            queries. Relevant styles for the following example can be found in
            <code><b>css/grid.css</b></code
            >.
          </p>
        </div>
