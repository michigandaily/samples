          This guide is also self-referential in that I will be describing
          concepts that are reflected in how this page is laid out. It will be
          useful to have the code for this page open as you read.

        <h2>Layout</h2>
        <p>
          Most websites include a CSS reset, a set of stylings that remove style
          inconsistencies between browsers. This page has a rather minimal reset
          to remove margin and padding from the body, and to remove margin from
          headings and paragraphs. While the default margins for text elements
          are useful to provide spacing, it is preferable to manually control
          the spacing through grid layout gaps.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a news organization, many of our special websites will require
          large amounts of prose. People tend to have a hard time reading when a
          text container is wide. This is particularly an issue for some people
          with disabilities.
        </p>
        <blockquote
          style="font-family: var(--font-serif); display: grid; gap: 0.5rem"
        >
          For people with some reading or vision disabilities, long lines of
          text can become a significant barrier. They have trouble keeping their
          place and following the flow of text. Having a narrow block of text
          makes it easier for them to continue on to the next line in a block.
          Lines should not exceed 80 characters or glyphs (40 if [Chinese,
          Japanese and Korean]), where glyphs are the element of writing in the
          writing system for the text.

        <p>
          Therefore, I start most prose-heavy layouts with a section that is 60
          to 80 characters wide. CSS includes a
          <code><b>ch</b></code> unit to work with the width of a single
          character glyph. Note that setting a maximum width is naturally
          responsive, even on mobile devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          In most cases, text should be centered on the screen. Centering can be
          accomplished with horizontal margin set to <code><b>auto</b></code
          >. It is also important for a section of text to take up all allotted
          space within the maximum width constraint by setting the width to
          <code><b>100%</b></code
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some padding should also be added around the text container to ensure
          that the text does not touch the screen edges. This is especially
          important for mobile devices. Note that padding will add to the width
          of the container by default, making mobile screens horizontally
          scrollable. To prevent this, set
          <code><b>box-sizing: border-box</b></code> on the text container.
        </p>
        <p>
          With all that we've described in terms of grid layout, maximum
          character width, text centering and mobile responsiveness, we arrive
          at the following set of styles for prose layout.
        </p>
        <pre><code><b>section {
  display: grid;
  gap: 0.5rem;

  max-width: 80ch;
  width: 100%;

  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 0.25rem 0.75rem;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}</b></code></pre>
        <p>
          Although I describe this as "prose layout," all of the ideas are
          pertinent to any good responsive layout, regardless of the amount of
          text content.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Scroll layout</h3>
        <p>Use scrollama. View examples</p>
      </section>

      <section style="max-width: unset; padding: 0">
        <div class="inline">
          <h3>Breaking out</h3>
          <p>
            Although this default width is useful for prose, there are also
            situations when you might want more width to work with. In those
            cases, you will want to create "breakout" sections.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div style="background-color: #d4c184; height: 350px"></div>
        <div class="inline">
          <p>
            In a breakout section, remove the maximum width associated with a
            section. Then, you will have the full width of the screen to work
            with.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div
          class="inline"
          style="
            background-color: #79d7e7;
            max-width: 800px;
            height: 350px;
            padding: 0;
          "
        ></div>
        <div class="inline">
          <p>
            If there are parts of the breakout section that you want to retain
            the prose width, you'll want to re-apply the styles that set the
            maximum character width. Furthermore, the maximum width can be
            customized to be more than the prose width but less than the full
            width, as demonstrated in the blue rectangle above.
